1 Introduction
In the current context of health crisis and movement restriction, crowd simulation allows to model the behavior of agents at the microscopic scale in order to calculate the gauges of people in public places. In a very simplified way, we tried to model this propagation of the virus within the crowd by calculating the number of interactions between "healthy" and "infected" people in two different situations. In a first step, we tried to calculate this propagation in a confined place. Then in a second time, we tried to model this propagation during a crowd evacuation from a place.
